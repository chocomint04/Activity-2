We utilize Python libraries such as Streamlit to create interactive visualizations, including line charts, 3D surface plots, violin plots, and more.
>Our group also written a conclusion on which graph is the most accurate to use for the laptop data set. With the use of libraries such as Mathplotlib, Pandas, Altair, and Numpy, we are able to efficiently visualize the given data sets and it's relationship with each other using different parameters.
